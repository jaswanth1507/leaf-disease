# Leaf Disease Detection Project

This project uses computer vision and deep learning to detect diseases in plant leaves.

## Models
- CNN-based detection model
- Vision Transformer (ViT) model
- Autoencoder for disease detection

## Directory Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw, processed, and test data
- `models/`: Contains saved models and configuration files
- `src/`: Source code for training, prediction, and visualization
- `app/`: Web application files
- `results/`: Visualizations and metrics
- `uploads/`: User uploaded images for prediction

## Setup
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the backend: `python src/utils/backend.py`
